    <h1>Main Heading (H1)</h1>
    <h2>Subheading (H2)</h2>
    <h3>Another Subheading (H3)</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph demonstrating various text styles. You can use <b>bold</b> text to emphasize important points, and <i>italic</i> text for titles or foreign words. Here, we can also <u>underline</u> specific words for additional emphasis.</p>
        
    <p>In programming, you might encounter inline code snippets like var x = 10;, which show how to declare a variable in JavaScript. The x variable can be used later in your code. If you need to represent keyboard shortcuts, you might use Ctrl+V to paste text.</p>

        <h3>Section One: Understanding HTML Elements</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements that describe the structure of a webpage. Each element is defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, a paragraph is defined using the &lt;p&gt; tag.</p>
        <p>Each element can also have attributes that provide additional information. For example, an image tag might look like this: &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"&gt;. Here, src specifies the image source, and alt provides an alternative text description.</p>
